## Features

-   Select any color for the pen.
-   Erase if you mess up something.
-   Rainbow pen colors each cell a random color.
-   Create a grid size up to 72 x 72.
-   Chilling background and music that can be muted.

## Roadmap

-   This is almost pure CSS and JS, but I might try HTML5 Canvas and inject some stuff into it.
-   Might add shading pen
-   Maybe save and export feature
